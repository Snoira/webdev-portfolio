        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I&#39;m a junior full-stack JavaScript developer. I recently
            graduated from Nackademin&#39;s Fullstack Web Development program,
            which concluded with a six-month internship at Funnel.
            <!-- <br /><br /> -->
            <!-- Before becoming a developer, I set out to tackle global issues
						by studying Environmental Science, including biology and
						geography. Eventually, I realized I preferred solving smaller,
						more hands-on problems in code, as well as the collaborative
						nature of being a developer, which led me to change direction. -->
            <br /><br />
            Other than coding, I've also found an interest in web design and user
            experience (UX). I'm excited to explore this further and incorporate
            design principles into my development work.
